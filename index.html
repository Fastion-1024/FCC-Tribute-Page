                            <p>
                                The city of Canluum lies close to the scarred and desolate wastes of the Blight, a
                                walled
                                haven from the dangers away to the north, and a refuge from the ill works of those who
                                serve
                                the Dark One.
                                Or so it is said. The city that greet Al'Lan Mandragoran, exiled king of Malkier and the
                                finest swordsman of his generation, is instead one that is rife with rumour and the
                                whisperings of Shadowspawn.
                                Proof, should he have requried it, that the Dark One grows powerful once more and that
                                his
                                minions are at work throughout the lands.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And yet it is within Canluum's walls that Lan will meet a woman who will shape his
                                destiny.
                                Moiraine is a young and powerful Aes Sedai who has journeyed to the city in search of a
                                bondsman.
                                She requires aid in a desperate quest to prove the truth of a vague and largely
                                discredited
                                prophecy - one that speaks of a means to turn back the shadow, and of a child who may be
                                the
                                dragon reborn.

                                The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend.

                                The Forsaken are loose, the Horn of Valere has been found and the dead are rising from

                                dreamless sleep.
                                The Prophecies are being fulfilled - but Rand al'Thor, the shepherd the Aes Sedai have
                                proclaimed as the Dragon Reborn, desperately seeks to escape his destiny.

                                But Rand cannot run forever. With every passing day the Dark one grows in strength and
                                strives to shatter his ancient prison, to break the Wheel, to bring an end to Time and
                                sunder the weave of the Patter.

                                The Stone of Tear, invulnerable fortress of legend, has fallen.
                                The Children of the Dragon have risen to the call of prophecy and march to the aid of

                                placed upon saidin - the male half of the True Source.
                                His Asha'man followers are also showing the signs of the insanity that once devastated

                                risk - a power that can annihilate Creation and bring an end to Time itself.

                                Battle, is imminent - and Rand al'Thor must ready himself to confront the Dark One.
                                But Rand must first negotiate a truce with the Seanchan armies, as their forces
                                increasingly
                                sap his strength.

                                All the while, an unseen foe is slowly pulling a noose tight around his neck.
                                To prevail, he must seek answers in Tel'aran'rhiod and find a way - at long last - to

                                He had hoped that his last confrontation with them would be the end of it, but the Wheel

                                The time is coming when he will again have to dance with the Snakes and the Foxes,

                            The original author of 'The Wheel of Time' series. Robert, finding books and reading at an
                            early age, taught himself to read by the age of four and was reading Mark Twain and Jules
                            Verne by the age of five.
                            He had a military career in the United States Army as a helicopter gunner, which included
                            two tours of Vietnam, during which he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Bronze
                            Star and two Vietnamese Gallantry Crosses.
                            After his tours ended, Robert attended The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina
                            and earned an undergraduate degree in physics.
                            After graduating he was employed by the United States Navy as a nuclear engineer in 1977. It
                            was at this time he began writing.

                            Robert chose the fantasy genre for his 'The Wheel of Time' series becuase it was his belief
                            that it would allow him to explore the themes of good and evil, right and wrong, honour and
                            duty, without having to confirm to mainstream beliefs that these were two side of the same
                            coin.
                            Robert began writing the first volume in 'The Wheel of Time', The Eye of the World, in 1984,
                            and it was published in January 1990.

                            On <time datetime="2006-03-23">23<sup>rd</sup> March 2006</time>, Robert disclosed that he
                            had been diagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis. He revealed that his median life expectancy was
                            four years with treatment.
                            However he reasured his fans not to worry about him, stating that he intended to live a long
                            and creative life.
                            Robert died whilst working on the 12<sup>th</sup> book in 2007. During his ilness he
                            prepared extensive notes so another author could complete the series according to his
                            wishes.
                            This honour was given to fellow Fantasy author and long time Wheel of Time fan, Brandon
                            Sanderson who along with Robert's wife and editor Harriet McDougal, decided to split the
                            final book into three, due to it being far too large to publish as one book.

                        <p>

                            Brandon Sanderson, born <time datime="1975-12-19">19<sup>th</sup> December 1975</time>,
                            became a passionate reader of high fantasy novels as a teenager and made several early
                            attempts at writing his own series.
                            This passion for writing continued on throughout his undergraduate and graduate studies,
                            cumulating in twelve novels of which only his sixth 'Elantris' was accepted by a publisher.
                            Elantris was published by Tor Books on <time datetime="2005-04-21">21<sup>st</sup> Apri 2005
                                and recieved generally favourable reviews.

                        <p>
                            Brandon Sanderson was selected by Robert Jordan's widow and editor, Harriet McDougal, to
                            complete the final book in Robert's 'The Wheel of Time' series after being deeply impressed
                            with Brandon's 'Mistborn' novel 'The Final Empire'.
                            After reviewing Robert's extensive notes and what was necessary to complete the series,
                            Brandon along with the publisher 'Tor' announced that the three books would be published
                            instead of one due to sheer amount of content needed.
